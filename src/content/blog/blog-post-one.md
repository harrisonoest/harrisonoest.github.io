# Getting Started with Git

## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.

### Key Features

- **Distributed Version Control**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository.
- **Branching and Merging**: Create branches to work on features without affecting the main codebase.
- **Speed**: Git operations are fast and efficient.

### Basic Git Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Add files to staging
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

## Why Use Git?

Git has become the standard for version control in the software industry for several reasons:

1. **History Tracking**: Git maintains a complete history of all changes.
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.
3. **Backup**: Remote repositories serve as backups of your code.

## Conclusion

Learning Git is essential for any developer. It not only helps in managing code but also facilitates collaboration in team environments.
