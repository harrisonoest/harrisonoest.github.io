# Getting Started with Docker

## Docker Fundamentals

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components that combine application source code with the operating system libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

### Why Docker?

- **Consistency**: "It works on my machine" becomes "It works on every machine"
- **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated environments
- **Efficiency**: Containers share OS resources, making them lightweight

### Basic Docker Commands

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id
```

## Docker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which builds, runs, and distributes Docker containers.

1. **Docker Client**: The primary way users interact with Docker
2. **Docker Daemon**: Background service that manages containers
3. **Docker Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers
4. **Docker Containers**: Runnable instances of Docker images

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a single command, you can create and start all the services from your configuration.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  database:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

## Conclusion

Docker has revolutionized how we develop, ship, and run applications, making it an essential tool in modern software development.
